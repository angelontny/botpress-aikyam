# Nginx Configuration
- Default configuration ( the recommended one ) was copied from the guide
- The created cache directory is /tmp/nginx but the one provided in the nginx configuration is /sr/nginx_cache
- Also, it's missing a lot of steps that are to be done before copying the nginx configuration i.e, creating the log directories ( I ended up using the default nginx configuration )

## To-do
- [ ] Need to change the server_name
- [ ] Need to copy the changes i made to the github repo
- [ ] Need to configure botpress external URL
